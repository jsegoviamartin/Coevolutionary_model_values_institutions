# Coevolutionary_model_values_institutions
Co-evolutionary model of value systems, institutions and cultural conventions. It incorporates compliance, confirmation, content and frequency biases into the learning and production algorithm.  As described in Chapter 5 (thesis).

The file [run_model_COEVO.py](https://github.com/jsegoviamartin/Coevolutionary_model_values_institutions/blob/master/run_model_COEVO.py) contains a commented version of the Python code used to implement the model, as described in the thesis dissertation (Ch. 5). You can use this script to run simulations using different parameter combiantions.

In the file [COEVO_plots](https://github.com/jsegoviamartin/Coevolutionary_model_values_institutions/blob/master/COEVO_plots.R) you can find some R code to replicate the plots I show in Ch.5. You just need to type the appropriate csv file name and run the script.

A preprint of this work will be available soon.
