# Coevolutionary_model_values_institutions
Co-evolutionary model of value systems, institutions and cultural conventions. It incorporates compliance, confirmation, content and frequency biases into the learning and production algorithm.  As described in Chapter 5 (thesis).

The file [run_model_COEVO.py](https://github.com/jsegoviamartin/Coevolutionary_model_values_institutions/blob/master/run_model_COEVO.py) contains a commented version of the Python code used to implement the model, as described in the thesis dissertation (Ch. 5).
